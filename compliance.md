How would you extend this pipeline to integrate with Corellium or Siemens EDA?

To extend this pipeline for integration with Corellium or Siemens EDA, the goal would be to simulate the firmware on virtual hardware platforms and incorporate deeper compliance and traceability into the build and test process. Corellium provides ARM-based virtual devices, making it ideal for running pre-silicon firmware in a highly controlled and observable environment. We could introduce a post-build step in the pipeline that uploads the compiled .elf or .hex firmware to Corellium via its API, triggers a test scenario, and collects execution logs or screenshots. Similarly, Siemens EDA offers robust pre-silicon verification capabilities; integrating it would mean exporting build artifacts and test vectors into a format that Siemens simulation tools can run, then feeding the simulation results back into GitHub Actions for validation and audit.


What changes would you make to meet ISO 26262 or FDA traceability requirements?
To align the pipeline with ISO 26262 or FDA requirements, the focus would shift heavily toward traceability, documentation, and validation evidence. Every step—from code commit to artifact generation—would need clear trace links. For example, test cases would be explicitly mapped to safety requirements using metadata files or traceability matrices, and every build artifact would be versioned with Git SHA, timestamps, and SBOM fingerprints. Validation steps would include static analysis, unit testing, and simulation results, all logged and exported as machine-readable artifacts for audits. The pipeline would also be extended to include approval gates, human sign-offs, and perhaps integration with ALM tools like Polarion or Jama Connect to complete the digital thread from requirement to deployment. This would create a secure, reproducible workflow aligned with safety and regulatory standards.
