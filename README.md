# Zephyr CI DevSecOps Pipeline

This repository demonstrates a secure, automated CI/CD pipeline tailored for embedded firmware development using Zephyr RTOS. The pipeline leverages GitHub Actions to build, simulate, validate, and trace firmware artifacts — with a strong emphasis on traceability, compliance, and reproducibility.

---

## **Project Description**

The goal of this project is to showcase an end-to-end DevSecOps workflow for embedded development. It takes a Zephyr-based firmware source, builds it for a virtual hardware target, runs simulation tests inside QEMU, captures logs, generates SBOMs, and uploads all relevant artifacts in a traceable format.

This approach allows teams to ensure high integrity, zero-downtime updates, automated rollback, and audit-ready compliance metadata with every firmware change — all integrated directly into GitHub workflows.

---

## **How the Pipeline Works**

- **Build Automation**: The CI pipeline automatically installs the Zephyr SDK, fetches dependencies, and builds a sample `hello_world` firmware targeting the `qemu_cortex_m3` board.
  
- **Simulation and Validation**: The compiled firmware is executed using QEMU, simulating an actual hardware run. The UART output is captured and parsed to validate that the firmware functions as expected.

- **Hashing and Integrity Check**: A SHA-256 hash of the `.elf` firmware binary is computed and stored, ensuring the output has not been tampered with and can be validated externally.

- **Metadata Generation**: The pipeline generates a `firmware_metadata.json` file, capturing Git SHA, build timestamp, board, and toolchain info — supporting traceability for audits or debugging.

- **SBOM Compliance**: A full Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) is generated using Syft in SPDX JSON format. This captures all dependencies included in the firmware, supporting supply chain compliance.

- **Structured Test Logs**: Raw UART output is saved, and a machine-readable JSON version is also created for automated log analysis and traceable test validation.

- **Artifact Upload**: All key outputs — firmware binary, hash, logs, SBOM, metadata — are uploaded to GitHub Actions as downloadable artifacts, ensuring reproducibility and traceability.

## **Features and Highlights**

- **End-to-end GitHub Actions-based CI/CD**
- **Automated QEMU-based firmware simulation**
- **SHA-256 firmware integrity validation**
- **SPDX-compliant SBOM generation using Syft**
- **Machine-readable UART test logs**
- **Traceable metadata for each build (Git SHA, timestamp, toolchain)**
- **Ready-to-download build artifacts from GitHub Actions**
- **Zero-downtime deployment foundation with rollback logic**
- **Open and extensible format supporting audit-ready traceability**

---

## **Generated Artifacts**

Each pipeline run produces:

- `zephyr.elf`: Compiled firmware binary
- `firmware.sha256`: Hash for integrity verification
- `output.log`: UART output log from QEMU simulation
- `test_log.json`: Structured JSON version of UART output
- `firmware_metadata.json`: Traceability info including Git SHA and build timestamp
- `sbom.spdx.json`: SPDX-compliant SBOM for dependency compliance

All of these can be downloaded directly from the GitHub Actions artifacts section after a successful pipeline run.
